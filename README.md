# JOMap
Joint Operations Typhoon Rising Base Assault Mission fixed after export. Includes the 05TR.mis, 05TR.wac, 05TR.dbf, and 05TR.bms files. Working mission and complete exported mission file for editing.

IMPORTANT: 
  * The mission has been exported from the 1.0.0 version of the game. Little to nothing that was originally in the mission was removed, BUT my own flavour has been added to the map.
  
  * It is possible to remove the flavour I added into the map more or less easily if you know the 'dfxmed' map editing tool. The original exported mission file does not contain any descriptions or names for any entities in the map.
  
  * I have named almost every important thing in the mission file, such as the areas, events, and groups. They WILL NOT all be recognizable to you until you do a bit of digging of your own, but most will make sense.
  
  * Events are named ENDING with (B) or (R). These are to indicate whether the event is concerning the BLUE team or the RED team, they will be useful to you in quickly finding which events you might want to look at if you only want to see events that concern the RED team or the BLUE team.

  * 05TR.wac is edited and not the original, but the original can easily be found witin the game files. The two important flavour additions are: friendly-fire no longer ends the mission, and there are a lot of mortars hitting the island

 THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO HAVE THIS OLD PIECE OF GAME HISTORY AVAILABLE FOR LEARNING AND GOING THROUGH YOUR NOSTALGIA HIT.
